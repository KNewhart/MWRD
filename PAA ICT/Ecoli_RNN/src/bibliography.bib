Two unfolding procedures were used: batch-wise and variable-wise. For the latter unfolding method, X and Y matrix augmentation with lagged variables were used in some models to incorporate process dynamics. The results have shown that batch-wise unfolding PLS models outperform the other approaches. The ANN models are good predictive models, but in this particular case-study, they do not outperform those multivariate projection models that use the same explanatory and response variables. Moreover, the latter models allow assessing if new data is similar to that used for model building (avoiding dangerous extrapolations), are very efficient in handling missing data, exhibit good predictive performance using only data collected from the sensors installed in the SBR and can provide useful information for process understanding.},

  abstract = {Water makes up about 70\% of the earth\&rsquo;s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.},

The monitored parameters were analysed by multivariate statistical methods: Principal Components Analysis and multiple partial linear regression. The WWTP operational conditions determine the sludge characteristics. The bacterial activity of the sludge in terms of extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was assessed using size exclusion chromatography and the internal structure of sludge flocs was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The diagnosis of three paper mill WWTP enabled the identification of an important EPS production, the presence of the nitrification process and the presence of PO34{\`A} nutrient in WWTP-A. These three main characteristics of WWTP-A were related with a systematically good sludge settling. In WWTP-B and C with bad settling, the bacterial activity was weak.},

Because a high amount of variables are daily measured, a coherent and structured approach of such a system is required to understand its inherent behavior and performance efficiency. In this sense, both principal factor analysis (PFA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) are multivariate techniques that have been widely applied to extract and structure information for different purposes. In this paper, both statistical tools are applied in an urban WWTP situated in the Southeast of Spain, a zone with special characteristics related to the geochemical background composition of water and an important use of fertilizers. Four main factors were extracted in association with nutrients, the ionic component, the organic load to the WWTP, and the efficiency of the whole process. HCA allowed distinguish between influent and effluent parameters, although a deeper examination resulted in a dendrogram with groupings similar to those previously reported for PFA.},

When measurements of the flow are available as well, the pollutant mass flow at the measuring point can be calculated. The measured data are used to estimate different models describing the load of pollutants in the sewer. A comparison of the models shows that a grey-box model is most informative and best in terms measured by the multiple correlation coefficient. The grey-box model is a state-space model, where the state represents the actual amount of deposition in the sewer, and the output from the model is the pollutant mass flow to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The model is formulated by means of stochastic differential equations. Harmonic functions are used to describe the dry weather diurnal load profiles. It is found that the accumulation of deposits in the sewer depends on previous rain events and flows. By means of on-line use of the grey-box models, it is possible to predict the amount of pollutants in a first flush at any time, and hence from the capacity of the plant to decide if and when the available detention basin is to be used for storage of wastewater. The mass flow models comprise an important improvement of the integrated control of sewer and WWTP including control of equalisation basins in the sewer system. Further improvements are expected by the introduction of an additive model where dry weather situations and storm situations are modelled separately before addition to the resulting model.},

  abstract = {In wastewater treatment plants, nitrifying systems are usually operated with elevated levels of aeration to avoid nitrification failures. This approach contributes significantly to operational costs and the carbon footprint of nitrifying wastewater treatment processes. In this study, we tested the effect of aeration rate on nitrification by correlating ammonia oxidation rates with the structure of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) community and AOB abundance in four parallel continuous-flow reactors operated for 43 days. Two of the reactors were supplied with a constant airflow rate of 0.1 liter/min, while in the other two units the airflow rate was fixed at 4 liters/min. Complete nitrification was achieved in all configurations, though the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was only 0.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 mg/liter in the low-aeration units. The data suggest that efficient performance in the low-DO units resulted from elevated AOB levels in the reactors and/or putative development of a mixotrophic AOB community. Denaturing gel electrophoresis and cloning of AOB 16S rRNA gene fragments followed by sequencing revealed that the AOB community in the low-DO systems was a subset of the community in the high-DO systems. However, in both configurations the dominant species belonged to the Nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage. Overall, the results demonstrated that complete nitrification can be achieved at low aeration in lab-scale reactors. If these findings could be extended to full-scale plants, it would be possible to minimize the operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions without risk of nitrification failure.},

One of the possible reasons, the slow learning or nonconvergence of large-scale networks, can now be overcome by the use of the nonrandom initial connection weight algorithm. The developed ANN model can then be optimized, after the elimination of nonrelevant inputs and finding the necessary number of hidden-layer ``neurons.'' Causal relationships can be extracted from the ANN process model, and the reasons for deviations from the model-predicted behavior can be analyzed. This paper describes the application of large-scale ANN in modeling of industrial plants.},

  abstract = {The removal of phosphorus (P) from domestic wastewater is primarily to reduce the potential for eutrophication in receiving waters, and is mandated and common in many countries. However, most P-removal technologies have been developed for use at larger wastewater treatment plants that have economies-of-scale, rigorous monitoring, and in-house operating expertise. Smaller treatment plants often do not have these luxuries, which is problematic because there is concern that P releases from small treatment systems may have greater environmental impact than previously believed. Here P-removal technologies are reviewed with the goal of determining which treatment options are amenable to small-scale applications. Significant progress has been made in developing some technologies for small-scale application, namely sorptive media. However, as this review shows, there is a shortage of treatment technologies for P-removal at smaller scales, particularly sustainable and reliable options that demand minimal operating and maintenance expertise or are suited to northern latitudes. In view of emerging regulatory pressure, investment should be made in developing new or adapting existing P-removal technologies, specifically for implementation at small-scale treatment works.},

  abstract = {Chlorine disinfection of biologically treated wastewater is practiced in many locations prior to environmental discharge or beneficial reuse. The effectiveness of chlorine disinfection processes may be influenced by several factors, such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, organic carbon concentration, and suspended solids. We investigated the use of Bayesian multilayer perceptron (BMLP) models as efficient and practical tools for compiling and analysing free chlorine and monochloramine virus disinfection performance as a multivariate problem. Corresponding to their relative susceptibility, Adenovirus 2 was used to assess disinfection by monochloramine and Coxsackievirus B5 was used for free chlorine. A BMLP model was constructed to relate key disinfection conditions (CT, pH, turbidity) to observed Log Reduction Values (LRVs) for these viruses at constant temperature. The models proved to be valuable for incorporating uncertainty in the chlor(am)ination performance estimation and interpolating between operating conditions. Various types of queries could be performed with this model including the identification of target CT for a particular combination of LRV, pH and turbidity. Similarly, it was possible to derive achievable LRVs for combinations of CT, pH and turbidity. These queries yielded probability density functions for the target variable reflecting the uncertainty in the model parameters and variability of the input variables. The disinfection efficacy was greatly impacted by pH and to a lesser extent by turbidity for both types of disinfections. Non-linear relationships were observed between pH and target CT, and turbidity and target CT, with compound effects on target CT also evidenced. This work demonstrated that the use of BMLP models had considerable ability to improve the resolution and understanding of the multivariate relationships between operational parameters and disinfection outcomes for wastewater treatment.},

  abstract = {Monitoring multivariate quality variables or data streams remains an important and challenging problem in statistical process control (SPC). Although the multivariate SPC has been extensively studied in the literature, designing distribution-free control schemes are still challenging and yet to be addressed well. This article develops a new nonparametric methodology for monitoring location parameters when only a small reference dataset is available. The key idea is to construct a series of conditionally distribution-free test statistics in the sense that their distributions are free of the underlying distribution given the empirical distribution functions. The conditional probability that the charting statistic exceeds the control limit at present given that there is no alarm before the current time point can be guaranteed to attain a specified false alarm rate. The success of the proposed method lies in the use of data-dependent control limits, which are determined based on the observations online rather than decided before monitoring. Our theoretical and numerical studies show that the proposed control chart is able to deliver satisfactory in-control run-length performance for any distributions with any dimension. It is also very efficient in detecting multivariate process shifts when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Meanwhile, the plant is suffering from high potential risks and the faults within it is difficult to be detected. Researchers have made efforts to diagnose the possible faults occurred in the system to further prevent the process from being broken down. Model-based method is proposed at the beginning and it receives effective monitoring results indeed. However, the mathematic model of the system should be known as prior, and it is challenging to achieve the goal. On the other hand, the Multivariate Statistical Process Monitoring (MSPM) does not require that people have clearly understood the process model before carrying out the diagnosis method. Two approaches based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) separately are included in the framework of MSPM. This paper firstly introduces PCA and PLS techniques, including the algorithms, the test statistic, and differences between them. Then the thesis proposes Benchmark Simulation Model No.1 (BSM1), which is used to testify the efficiency of the proposed methods. Finally, the simulation is carried out and the result is reported.},

The performance of three commonly used advanced wastewater treatment trains, coagulation-sand filter, coagulation-biological aerated filter (BAF) and ozonation-biological activated carbon (BAC), in removing fifteen residual contaminants and bio-toxicity of the effluent from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were investigated. Relatively high level of OMPs (0.69\textendash{}14.71~{$\mu$}g/L), genotoxicity (22.64~{$\mu$}g 4-NQO/L) and estrogenic activity (1.4~{$\mu$}g E2/L) were observed from the secondary effluent (SE). Limited OMPs and bio-toxicity reduction was achieved during coagulation with 20~mg/L of polymeric aluminium and sand filter. Ozonation exhibited high advantage in OMPs, genotoxicity and estrogenic activity reduction. More than 80\% of removal was achieved for most OMPs after ozonation with normalized dose of 1.25~mg O3/mg DOC, and the removal of OMPs was consistent well with the second reaction kinetics constants of OMPs with ozone. Based on Pearson correlation analysis, spectroscopy indicators such as UV254 and total fluorescence (TF) exhibited a high positive correlation with genotoxicity reduction, while estrogenic activity was related well with OMPs variation. To sum up, spectroscopic indicators showed a high potential to indicate the OMPs and bio-toxicity of SE.},

  abstract = {For control and automation of biological treatment processes, lack of reliable on-line sensors to measure water quality parameters is one of the most important problems to overcome. Many parameters cannot be measured directly with on-line sensors. The accuracy of existing hardware sensors is also not sufficient and maintenance problems such as electrode fouling often cause trouble. This paper deals with the development of software sensor techniques that estimate the target water quality parameter from other parameters using the correlation between water quality parameters. We focus our attention on the preprocessing of noisy data and the selection of the best model feasible to the situation. Problems of existing approaches are also discussed. We propose a hybrid neural network as a software sensor inferring wastewater quality parameter. Multivariate regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and a hybrid technique that combines principal component analysis as a preprocessing stage are applied to data from industrial wastewater processes. The hybrid ANN technique shows an enhancement of prediction capability and reduces the overfitting problem of neural networks. The result shows that the hybrid ANN technique can be used to extract information from noisy data and to describe the nonlinearity of complex wastewater treatment processes.},

A unified monitoring index combined T2 with SPE is also suggested. The proposed monitoring method based on DKPCA is applied to a simulated nonlinear process and a wastewater treatment process. A comparison study of PCA, dynamic PCA, KPCA, and DKPCA is investigated in terms of type I error rate, type II error rate, and detection delay.

Robustness, the fast initial response feature for CUSUM schemes, and combined Shewhart-CUSUM schemes are discussed.},

Comparisons are made for a variety of artificially generated nonlinear ARIMA data sets that simulate the characteristics of wastewater process variables and watershed variables, as well as two real-world wastewater data sets. While the time delay neural network model was more accurate for the two real-world wastewater data sets, the neural networks were not always more accurate than linear ARIMA for the artificial nonlinear data sets. In some cases of the artificial nonlinear data, where multi-period predictions are made, the linear ARIMA model provides a more accurate result than the time delay neural network. This study suggests that researchers and practitioners should carefully consider the nature and intended use of water quality data if choosing between neural networks and other statistical methods for wastewater process control or watershed environmental quality management.},

  abstract = {Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) has been shown to be an important variable in water quality management and planning. However, BOD is difficult to measure and needs longer time periods (5 days) to get results. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are being used increasingly to predict and forecast water resource variables. The objective of this research was to develop an ANNs model to estimate daily BOD in the inlet of wastewater biochemical treatment plants. The plantscale data set (364 daily records of the year 2005) was obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant. Various combinations of daily water quality data, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), water discharge (Qw), suspended solid (SS), total nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) are used as inputs into the ANN so as to evaluate the degree of effect of each of these variables on the daily inlet BOD. The results of the ANN model are compared with the multiple linear regression model (MLR). Mean square error, average absolute relative error, and coefficient of determination statistics are used as comparison criteria for the evaluation of the model performance. The ANN technique whose inputs are COD, Qw, SS, N, and P gave mean square errors of 708.01, average absolute relative errors of 10.03\%, and a coefficient of determination 0.919, respectively. On the basis of the comparisons, it was found that the ANN model could be employed successfully in estimating the daily BOD in the inlet of wastewater biochemical treatment plants. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2008},

In detail, inorganics (such as reduced iron and orthophosphate) have shown to be the main drivers of the exponential decay: iron, particularly, has proved to directly consume PAA due to its catalysing capacity, whereas orthophosphate has shown to mainly interact with iron, acting as a chelating compound towards iron and consequently reducing the iron effect in consuming PAA. As for organics, proteins such as, casein and peptone, have been highlighted as the main cause of the initial PAA demand, probably due to the homolytic fission of PAA to generate peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, which are known to have a high reactivity towards proteins. Finally, a model for predicting the residual PAA concentration was obtained and validated; uncertainty analysis was also performed by a series of Monte Carlo simulations to propagate input uncertainties to the model output.},

In the present study we implemented a simple dynamic control strategy for nutrient-removal in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating variable tank truck cleaning wastewater. The control system was based on derived signals from two low-cost and robust sensors that are very common in activated sludge plants, i.e. oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen. The amount of wastewater fed during anoxic filling phases, and the number of filling phases in the SBR cycle, were determined by the appearance of the `nitrate knee' in the profile of the ORP. The phase length of the subsequent aerobic phases was controlled by the oxygen uptake rate measured online in the reactor. As a result, the sludge loading rate (F/M ratio), the volume exchange rate and the SBR cycle length adapted dynamically to the activity of the activated sludge and the actual characteristics of the wastewater, without affecting the final effluent quality.},

The DO concentration in the aeration tank(s) is maintained at a desired level by using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Since the traditional PID parameter adjustment is not adaptive, the unknown disturbances make it difficult to adjust the DO concentration rapidly and precisely to maintain at a desired level. A Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network (NN)-based adaptive PID (RBFNNPID) algorithm is proposed and simulated in this paper for better control of DO in an activated sludge process-based wastewater treatment. The powerful learning and adaptive ability of the RBF neural network makes the adaptive adjustment of the PID parameters to be realized. Hence, when the wastewater quality and quantity fluctuate, adjustments to some parameters online can be made by RBFNNPID algorithm to improve the performance of the controller. The RBFNNPID algorithm is based on the gradient descent method. Simulation results comparing the performance of traditional PID and RBFNNPID in maintaining the DO concentration show that the RBFNNPID control algorithm can achieve better control performances. The RBFNNPID control algorithm has good tracking, anti-disturbance and strong robustness performances.},

  abstract = {Data-driven modeling techniques are applied to process data from wastewater treatment plants to provide valuable additional information for optimal plant control. The application of data-driven modeling techniques, however, bears some risk because the generated models are of non-mechanistic nature and they thus do not always describe the plant processes appropriately. In this study, a procedure to build software sensors based on sensor data available in the process information system is defined and used to compare several techniques suitable for data-driven modeling, including generalized least squares regression, artificial neural networks, self-organizing maps and random forests. Three different degrees of expert knowledge are defined and considered mainly for optimum input signal selection and model interpretation. In two full-scale experiments, software sensors are created. The experiments reveal that even with linear modeling techniques, it is possible to automatically generate accurate software sensors. Hence, this justifies the selection of the most parsimonious and transparent models and to motivate their investigation by taking into account available expert knowledge. A high degree of expert knowledge is valuable for long-term accuracy, but can lead to performance decreases in short-term predictions. With regard to safe on-site deployment, the consideration of uncertainty measures is crucial to prevent misinterpretation of software-sensor outputs in the cases of rare events or model input failures.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on sustainability impacts as wastewater treatment plants implement treatment technologies to meet increasingly stringent nutrient limits. The objective is to determine if a point of ``diminishing returns'' is reached where the sustainability impacts of increased levels of nutrient removal outweigh the benefits of better water quality.Five different hypothetical treatment trains at a nominal 10 mgd flow were developed to meet treatment targets that ranged from cBOD mode (Level 1) to four different nutrient removal targets. The nutrient removal targets ranged from 8 mg N/L; 1 mg P/L (Level 2) to the most stringent at \&lt;2 mg N/L; \&lt;0.02 mg P/L (Level 5).Given that sustainability is a broad term, the industry-accepted three pillars of sustainability were evaluated and discussed, and particular emphasis was placed on the environmental and economic pillars. The following variables received the most attention: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a water quality surrogate that reflects potential algal growth, capital and operational costs, energy demand, and consumables such as chemicals, gas, diesel, etc.The results from the GHG emissions metric are shown below. Note that biogas cogeneration is represented by negative values as biogas production can be used to offset energy demands. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions values are based on the average biological nutrient removal (BNR) and non-BNR plants evaluated in the United States national survey by Ahn et al. (2010b). The error bars represent the data range of the national survey.The GHG emissions results suggest that a point of diminishing return is reached at Level 4 (3 mg N/L; 0.1 mg P/L). The GHG emissions show a steady increase from Levels 1 to 4, followed by a 65\% increase when moving from Level 4 to 5. Despite a 70\% increase in GHGs, the discharged nutrient load only decreases by 1\% by going from Level 4 to 5. The primary contributors to GHG emissions are energy related (aeration, pumping, mixing). The GHG emissions associated with chemical use increases for the more stringent nutrient targets that required chemical treatment in addition to biological nutrient removal.In terms of cost, the total project capital cost increases approximately one-third from \$9.3 million to \$12.7 million for changing from Level 1 to 2, followed by a more than doubling in cost when changing from Level 1 to 5. Total project capital costs in this report are for a Greenfield plant. The operational cost increase between levels is more pronounced than total project capital cost with more than five-times increase from Level 1 to 5 (\$250/MG treated to \$1,370/MG treated, respectively).This report focused on in-plant (point source) options for nutrient removal and the implications for cost and sustainability. Other approaches, such as addressing non-point sources, could be added to the assessment. Rather than focusing strictly on point source dischargers and requiring Level 4 or 5 treatments, Level 3 or 4 treatments complimented with best management practices of non-point sources might be a more sustainable approach at achieving comparable water quality.This title belongs to WERF Research Report Series.ISBN: 9781780400433 (Print)ISBN: 9781780403298 (eBook)},

  abstract = {A calibrated dynamic biological ASM model of a full scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used to analyze the energy costs of different compartments and devices. The overall energy consumption (0.64kWh/m3 of permeate) of the studied MBR in Schilde (Belgium) was good compared to other full scale municipal MBR plants. It is however still much higher than conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment (0.3kWh/m3). Energy demands of the full scale MBR system were compared with a treatment train believed to deliver a comparable effluent quality: CAS followed by Ultrafiltration and UV. It was concluded that from an energy perspective the MBR technology is not yet sufficiently competitive. The MBR technology leads to process specificities which all impact on the energy consumption. While the higher MLSS concentrations implied significant mixing energy costs and reduced oxygen transfer, the smaller floc size did not reflect in a significant aeration energy saving. The impact of the filtration process on the overall energy consumption could be reduced if the coarse aeration flow would be better integrated in the biological process scheme of submerged MBRs. However this work indicates a minimal contribution of the coarse aeration flow to the biological oxygen requirements.},

To achieve this goal, simulation and optimisation software and off-line optimisation techniques were used. As a result of the optimisation of the dissolved oxygen controller, a more stable system was obtained. Because of the stability of the system, the quality of the effluent and activated sludge and the operating life of the aeration equipment was increased.

In total, 73 regular samples were collected from key locations throughout treatment processes: post-preliminary, post-MBR, post-secondary, post-tertiary, and post-disinfection (UV or chlorine). Out of 19 post-preliminary samples, adenovirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was detected in all 19, enterovirus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was detected in 15, and norovirus GI by qRT-PCR was detected in 11. Norovirus GII and Hepatitis A virus were not detected in any samples, and rotavirus was detected in one sample but could not be quantified. Although culturable viruses were found in 12 out of 19 post-preliminary samples, they were not detected in any post-secondary, post-MBR, post-ultraviolet, or post-chlorine samples. Median log removals for all organisms were higher for MBR secondary treatment (3.02 to {$>$}6.73) than for conventional secondary (1.53\textendash{}4.19) treatment. Ultraviolet disinfection after MBR treatment provided little additional log removal of any organism except for somatic coliphage ({$>$}2.18), whereas ultraviolet or chlorine disinfection after conventional secondary treatment provided significant log removals (above the analytical variability) of all bacterial indicators (1.18\textendash{}3.89) and somatic and F-specific coliphage (0.71 and {$>$}2.98). Median log removals of adenovirus across disinfection were low in both MBR and conventional secondary plants (no removal detected and 0.24), and few removals of individual samples were near or above the analytical variability of 1.2 log genomic copies per liter. Based on qualitative examinations of plots showing reductions of organisms throughout treatment processes, somatic coliphage may best represent the removal of viruses across secondary treatment in both MBR and conventional secondary plants. F-specific coliphage and Escherichia coli may best represent the removal of viruses across the disinfection process in MBR facilities, but none of the indicators represented the removal of viruses across disinfection in conventional secondary plants.},

  abstract = {This review paper focuses on modelling of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). White-box modelling is widely applied in this field, with learning, design and process optimisation as the main applications. The introduction of the ASM model family by the IWA task group was of great importance, providing researchers and practitioners with a standardised set of basis models. This paper introduces the nowadays most frequently used white-box models for description of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal activated sludge processes. These models are mainly applicable to municipal wastewater systems, but can be adapted easily to specific situations such as the presence of industrial wastewater. Some of the main model assumptions are highlighted, and their implications for practical model application are discussed. A step-wise procedure leads from the model purpose definition to a calibrated WWTP model. Important steps in the procedure are: model purpose definition, model selection, data collection, data reconciliation, calibration of the model parameters and model unfalsification. The model purpose, defined at the beginning of the procedure, influences the model selection, the data collection and the model calibration. In the model calibration a process engineering approach, i.e. based on understanding of the process and the model structure, is needed. A calibrated WWTP model, the result of an iterative procedure, can usually be obtained by only modifying few model parameters, using the default parameter sets as a starting point. Black-box, stochastic grey-box and hybrid models are useful in WWTP applications for prediction of the influent load, for estimation of biomass activities and effluent quality parameters. These modelling methodologies thus complement the process knowledge included in white-box models with predictions based on data in areas where the white-box model assumptions are not valid or where white-box models do not provide accurate predictions. Artificial intelligence (AI) covers a large spectrum of methods, and many of them have been applied in applications related to WWTPs. AI methodologies and white-box models can interact in many ways; supervisory control systems for WWTPs are one evident application. Modular agent-based systems combining several AI and modelling methods provide a great potential. In these systems, AI methods on one hand can maximise the knowledge extracted from data and operator experience, and subsequently apply this knowledge to improve WWTP control. White-box models on the other hand allow evaluating scenarios based on the available process knowledge about the WWTP. A white-box model calibration tool, an AI based WWTP design tool and a knowledge representation tool in the WWTP domain are other potential applications where fruitful interactions between AI methods and white-box models could be developed.},

  abstract = {Drinking water contaminated by micro-organisms can be a major risk to public health. Disinfection is used to destroy micro-organisms that are potentially dangerous to humans. In order to prevent bacterial regrowth, it is also desirable to maintain a disinfectant residual throughout the water distribution system. The most commonly used disinfectant is chlorine. If the dosing rate of chlorine is too low, there may be insufficient residual at the end of the distribution system, resulting in bacterial regrowth. On the other hand, the addition of too much chlorine can lead to customer complaints about taste and odour, corrosion of the pipe network and the formation of potentially carcinogenic by-products. Consequently, in order to determine the optimal chlorine dosing rate, it is necessary to be able to predict chlorine decay in the network. In this paper three different data-driven techniques are used to predict chlorine concentrations at two key locations in the Hope Valley water distribution system, located to the north of Adelaide, South Australia. The data-driven methods applied include a linear regression model and two artificial neural networks: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP); and the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN). A 5-year data set containing routinely measured parameters is used for model development and validation. The results indicate that data-driven techniques are relatively successful in predicting chlorine concentrations in the distribution system. This is despite the fact that there is no hydraulic model of the system, and that only data that are collected on a routine basis were used for model development.},

  abstract = {The critical flux concept has been widely used to investigate fouling mechanisms in membrane processes, including membrane bioreactors. In this field, the concept is commonly coupled to the operation time to evaluate the actual flux ``sustainability''. Most researches have been carried out on bench or small pilot scale rigs. This study is focused on the optimisation of hydraulic/hydrodynamic conditions on a large pilot scale MBR to reasonably reflect operation of full scale systems. Short-term tests have been carried out according to the classical flux-step protocol with a view to evaluating the optimum membrane aeration rate. Long-term tests under constant aeration intensity (0.048Nm3m-2s-1) gave a linear relationship between the applied flux and the sustainability time. The effect of air-sparging was found not to affect the critical flux above a given aeration intensity, though a significant impact was observed in terms of membrane permeability recovery in stepping back operation from super-critical to sub-critical. Comparison with other studies seems to indicate the feedwater characteristics to be the most important factor in the sub-critical fouling rate. The role of extracellular polymeric substances in sub-critical fouling was confirmed by the removal efficiencies for proteins and carbohydrates, but the difference between EPS concentration in the sludge water phase and in the permeate was not a fair indicator to describe the TMP jump.},

  abstract = {With sustainable development as their overarching goal, Urban Water System (UWS) managers need to take into account all social, economic, technical and environmental facets related to their decisions. Decision support systems (DSS) have been used widely for handling such complexity in water treatment, having a high level of popularity as academic exercises, although little validation and few full-scale implementations reported in practice. The objective of this paper is to review the application of artificial intelligence methods (mainly machine learning) to UWS and to investigate the integration of these methods into DSS. The results of the review suggest that artificial neural networks is the most popular method in the water and wastewater sectors followed by clustering. Bayesian networks and swarm intelligence/optimization have shown a spectacular increase in the water sector in the last 10 years, being the latest techniques to be incorporated but overtaking case-based reasoning. Whereas artificial intelligence applications to the water sector focus on modelling, optimization or data mining for knowledge generation, their encapsulation into functional DSS is not fully explored. Few academic applications have made it into decision making practice. We believe that the reason behind this misuse is not related to the methods themselves but rather to the disassociation between the fields of water and computer engineering, the limited practical experience of academics, and the great complexity inherently present.},

The importance of trustworthy information on nitrate-nitrogen concentrations is emphasized by their employment in control loops enhancing nitrogen removal. In this paper, we propose an automatic system for deciding whether the use of estimates or corresponding hardware measurements is preferable given the current condition in filters. The presented switching system is based on ranking the estimates and the measurements, and a preferability index that combines the assigned ranks. The ranking procedure employs a robust principal component analysis and statistics used as the measures of fit. The switching system was demonstrated to enable the employment of measurements and estimates in a complementary manner in operating the post-filtration unit.},

The Viikinm{\"a}ki plant is the largest municipal wastewater treatment facility in Finland. It is monitored with ample instrumentation, though their potential is not yet fully exploited. One reason that prevents the use of the instrumentation in plant control is the occasional insufficient measurement performance. Therefore, we investigate an intelligent anomaly detection system for the activated sludge process in order to motivate a more efficient use of sensors in the process operation. The anomaly detection methodology is based on principal component analysis. Because the state of the process fluctuates, moving-window extensions are used to adapt the analysis to the time-varying conditions. The results show that both instrument and process anomalies were successfully detected using the proposed algorithm and the variables responsible for the anomalies correctly isolated. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm represents a convenient improvement for supporting the efficient operation of wastewater treatment plants.},

Daily records of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) concentrations through various stages of the treatment process over 10 months were obtained from the plant laboratory. Exploratory data analysis was used to detect relationships in the data and evaluate data dependence. Two ANN-based models for prediction of BOD and SS concentrations in plant effluent are presented. The appropriate architecture of the neural network models was determined through several steps of training and testing of the models. The ANN-based models were found to provide an efficient and a robust tool in predicting WWTP performance.},

Monitoring wastewater processes is helpful not only for evaluating the process operating conditions but also for inspecting product quality. This paper presents a flexible and efficient fault detection approach based on unsupervised deep learning to monitor the operating conditions of WWTPs. Specifically, this approach integrates a deep belief networks (DBN) model and a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) to separate normal from abnormal features by simultaneously taking advantage of the feature-extraction capability of DBNs and the superior predicting capacity of OCSVM. Here, the DBN model, which is a powerful tool with greedy learning features, accounts for the nonlinear aspects of WWTPs, while OCSVM is used to reliably detect the faults. The developed DBN-OCSVM approach is tested through a practical application on data from a decentralized WWTP in Golden, CO, USA. The results from the DBN-OCSVM are compared with two other detectors: DBN-based K-nearest neighbor and K-means algorithms. The results show the capability of the developed strategy to monitor the WWTP, suggesting that it can raise an early alert to the abnormal conditions.},

Since next generation shotgun sequencing (NGS) is now widely used to identify and quantify bacteria, we investigated the bacterial flora of saliva microbiomes of two healthy volunteers and five datasets from the Human Microbiome Project, along with a control dataset containing short NGS reads from bacterial species representative of the bacterial flora of human saliva. GENIUS, a system designed to identify and quantify bacterial species using unassembled short NGS reads was used to identify the bacterial species comprising the microbiomes of the saliva samples and datasets. Results, achieved within minutes and at greater than 90\% accuracy, showed more than 175 bacterial species comprised the bacterial flora of human saliva, including bacteria known to be commensal human flora but also Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Gamma proteobacteria. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) analysis in parallel, reported ca. five times more species than those actually comprising the in silico sample. Both GENIUSand BLAST analyses of saliva samples identified major genera comprising the bacterial flora of saliva, but GENIUS provided a more precise description of species composition, identifying to strain in most cases and delivered results at least 10,000 times faster. Therefore, GENIUS offers a facile and accurate system for identification and quantification of bacterial species and/or strains in metagenomic samples.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this work several feed-forward back propagation neural networks (FFBP) were trained in order to model, and subsequently control, methane production in anaerobic digesters. To produce data for the training of the neural nets, four anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactors were operated in steady-state conditions at organic loading rates (Br) of about 2kgm-3d-1 chemical oxygen demand, and disturbed by pulse-like increase of the organic loading rate. For the pulses additional carbon sources like flour, sucrose, 1,2-diethylen glycol or vegetable oil were added to the basic feed, which consisted of surplus and primary sludge of a local waste-water treatment plant, to increase the chemical oxygen demand. Measured parameters were: gas composition, methane production rate, volatile fatty acid concentration, pH, redox potential, volatile suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand of feed and effluent. A hierarchical system of nets was developed and embedded in a decision support system to find out which is the best feeding profile for the next time steps in advance. A 3-3-1 FFBP simulated the pH with a regression coefficient of 0.82. A 9-3-3 FFBP simulated the volatile fatty acid concentration in the sludge with a regression coefficient of 0.86. And a 9-3-2 FFBP simulated the gas production and gas composition with a regression coefficient of 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. A lab-scale anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactor controlled by this tool was able to maintain a methane concentration of about 60\% at a rather high gas production rate of between 5 and 5.6m3m-3d-1.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Due to the complexity of nonlinear and biochemical phenomena involved in anaerobic wastewater treatment units, efficient operation and control is limited and difficult. The objective of this study was to implement a new multi-objective control strategy to simultaneously optimise the effluent chemical oxygen demand (CODeff) and the biogas flow rate (Qgas) in an anaerobic bioreactor using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II (NSGA-II) and genetic algorithm\textendash{}artificial neural network (GA-ANN). The novel approach considered two operational objectives, i.e. control of the effluent quality and control of the maximum production rate of biogas, and took advantage of the difference between the dynamics of the liquid and gas phases using variables from both phases. RESULTS Based on the relatively lower values for the mean square error, the root mean square normalised error, and the mean absolute percentage error, as well as higher values for the correlation coefficient, GA-ANN models achieve better performances than ANN models. Based on GA-ANN and NSGA-II, a more flexible and precise optimisation process was allowed, and an optimal balance between effluent quality and biogas flow rate of the anaerobic bioreactor can be achieved. CONCLUSION The proposed GA-ANN models were shown to be capable of dynamically predicting CODeff and Qgas. Meanwhile the optimisation system developed may offer a useful tool for simulation, design, control and optimisation of anaerobic biodigesters. \textcopyright{} 2014 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {In recent decades, water quality standards for wastewater treatment have become more stringent, increasing costs and energy required to reduce pollutants. Wetland assimilation is a low-cost and low-energy alternative to traditional tertiary wastewater treatment where secondarily treated and disinfected municipal effluent is discharged primarily into freshwater forested wetlands in coastal Louisiana. In this paper, costs per gallon of treatment capacity for conventional secondary and tertiary treatment were compared to those for assimilation wetlands. Cost analysis reports were used to determine costs per gallon of treatment capacity for conventional wastewater treatment facilities, including costs for conveyance between the collection system and the assimilation wetland site, and between the treatment and disposal sites if they could not be co-located. Capital and operation and maintenance costs were considered. Because all wastewater treatment plants are required to treat at least to secondary standards, costs for primary and secondary treatment were combined. If necessary, these costs were adjusted for inflation to 2017 dollars using an average inflation rate of 2.19 percent and a cumulative inflation rate of 50.84 percent. To determine costs per gallon of treatment capacity for assimilation wetlands, actual costs provided by the project engineer were used when available. To simulate the future costs of facility construction and compare the replacement costs of conventional secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment facilities and treatment wetlands in the context of energy prices, U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) data for the price index for inputs to construction were used, as were the Energy Information Administration (EIA) data for the price of crude oil to model future wastewater treatment plant construction and operation costs. The cost for the Mandeville assimilation wetland included \$1 million for the price of the land. Future costs of treatment facility construction and operation were modeled relative to average price of construction inputs between 1998 and 2015 using the projected price of crude oil. When treatment costs were compared among secondary, tertiary, and assimilation wetlands, mean cost for assimilation wetlands was \$0.60 per gallon ({$>$}1 MGD capacity) compared to \$4.90 and \$6.50 per gallon for secondary and tertiary treatment, respectively. The lower total costs and energy requirements for assimilation wetlands result in lower variability in the price of construction and operation. Wetland assimilation is more economical than conventional wastewater treatment, especially compared to advanced secondary and tertiary treatment. It is likely that energy costs will increase significantly in coming decades. Because conventional secondary and tertiary treatment are energy intensive, increases in energy costs will significantly increase the costs of these treatment systems. Treatment systems that combine lower technology (e.g., oxidation ponds) secondary treatment with wetland assimilation are less likely to be impacted by rising energy costs than traditional wastewater treatment.},

The data used to generate the models consisted of measurements of flow, temperature, BOD5, suspended solids, and ammonia nitrogen over nearly a 3-year period. The data set was characterized by periodically missing values during weekends and holidays. A two-directional exponential smoothing method was developed to estimate the values of those missing data points, prior to time series modeling. Several commonly used time series models, including the exponential smoothing model, ARIMA model, and the dynamic regression model, were applied to the time series of the five plant influent variables. The best models for each influent variable were selected based on various statistics and the ability of the models to forecast future values in the time series. The time series models were then used to simulate random time series of the influent variables with the same statistical characteristics as the original data. The original and randomly generated time series were characterized by similar means, standard deviations, cross-correlations and autocorrelation functions. These randomly generated time series can be used in conjunction with dynamic process models to evaluate the ability of a given design to effectively treat effluent flows under conditions of variability different than those present in the historical data.},

  abstract = {Remarkable advances in computation and data storage and the ready availability of huge data sets have been the keys to the growth of the new disciplines of data mining and machine learning, while the enormous success of the Human Genome Project has opened up the field of bioinformatics.  These exciting developments, which led to the introduction of many innovative statistical tools for high-dimensional data analysis, are described here in detail. The author takes a broad perspective; for the first time in a book on multivariate analysis, nonlinear methods are discussed in detail as well as linear methods. Techniques covered range from traditional multivariate methods, such as multiple regression, principal components, canonical variates, linear discriminant analysis, factor analysis, clustering, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analysis, to the newer methods of density estimation, projection pursuit, neural networks, multivariate reduced-rank regression, nonlinear manifold learning, bagging, boosting, random forests, independent component analysis, support vector machines, and classification and regression trees. Another unique feature of this book is the discussion of database management systems.  This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers in statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, cognitive sciences, business, medicine, bioinformatics, and engineering. Familiarity with multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics is required. The book presents a carefully-integrated mixture of theory and applications, and of classical and modern multivariate statistical techniques, including Bayesian methods. There are over 60 interesting data sets used as examples in the book, over 200 exercises, and many color illustrations and photographs.},

  abstract = {A burst in a water distribution system (WDS) results from the pipe rupture resulting in loss of water and disruptions to customer service. Rapid burst detection increases resilience by reducing the time to identify that a break has occurred, to isolate the failed pipes and to recovery service. This study compares three univariate and three multivariate Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods with respect to their detectability. The univariate SPC methods are the Western Electric Company (WEC) rules, the Cumulative Sum method (CUSUM) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) method while three multivariate methods are Hotelling T2 method and the multivariate versions of CUSUM and EWMA. A method's detectability is determined by detection efficiency and effectiveness. To test the methods, nodal pressures and pipe flow rates were generated from a real hydraulic model and detectability is computed for flow and pressure meters in alternative configurations.},

The three methods evaluated included one biologic type (MS-2 phage), that has been employed previously; and two, new non-biologic types (24-nanometre polystyrene fluorescent dyed microspheres and fluorescent Rhodamine WT [R-WT] dye, molecular mass 496 daltons). All three surrogates were employed in a manner intended to show a minimum of 4-logs removal by the NF and RO membranes selected for test. Methods of compromisation included a pinhole induced through one membrane leaf in the spiral wound NF/RO element, and both cracking of and removal of sections from one of the permeate tube o-rings. Testing was conducted on two source waters, representing brackish surface water and effluent categories: a microfiltered secondary effluent and a river water. The river water is characterized by low to moderate TDS and high TOC and was treated with conventional alum coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and granular media filtration for subsequent membrane processing.},

PCA has been used by several authors to develop techniques to monitor chemical processes and detect the presence of disturbances [1\textendash{}5]. In past work, we have developed methods which not only detect disturbances, but isolate the sources of the disturbances [4]. The approach was based on static PCA models, T2 and Q charts [6], and a model bank of possible disturbances. In this paper we use a well-known `time lag shift' method to include dynamic behavior in the PCA model. The proposed dynamic PCA model development procedure is desirable due to its simplicity of construction, and is not meant to replace the many well-known and more elegant procedures used in model identification. While dynamic linear model identification, and time lag shift are well known methods in model building, this is the first application we are aware of in the area of statistical process monitoring. Extensive testing on the Tennessee Eastman process simulation [7] demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {In recent years, hybrid neural network approaches, which combine mechanistic and neural network models, have received considerable attention. These approaches are potentially very efficient for obtaining more accurate predictions of process dynamics by combining mechanistic and neural network models in such a way that the neural network model properly accounts for unknown and nonlinear parts of the mechanistic model. In this work, a full-scale coke-plant wastewater treatment process was chosen as a model system. Initially, a process data analysis was performed on the actual operational data by using principal component analysis. Next, a simplified mechanistic model and a neural network model were developed based on the specific process knowledge and the operational data of the coke-plant wastewater treatment process, respectively. Finally, the neural network was incorporated into the mechanistic model in both parallel and serial configurations. Simulation results showed that the parallel hybrid modeling approach achieved much more accurate predictions with good extrapolation properties as compared with the other modeling approaches even in the case of process upset caused by, for example, shock loading of toxic compounds. These results indicate that the parallel hybrid neural modeling approach is a useful tool for accurate and cost-effective modeling of biochemical processes, in the absence of other reasonably accurate process models. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A hybrid approach, by combining a nonlinear PLS approach with a dynamic modeling method, is potentially very efficient for obtaining more accurate prediction of nonlinear process dynamics. In this study, neural network PLS (NNPLS) were combined with finite impulse response (FIR) and auto-regressive with exogenous (ARX) inputs to model a full-scale biological wastewater treatment plant.

Suitable structures of ANN models were automatically and conveniently optimized by a genetic algorithm rather than the conventional trial and error method. The sequential modelling approach, which is composed of two parts, a process disturbance estimator and a process behaviour predictor, was also presented to develop multivariate dynamic models. In particular, the process disturbance estimator was first employed to estimate the influent quality. The process behaviour predictor then sequentially predicted the effluent quality based on the estimated influent quality from the process disturbance estimator with other process variables. The efficiencies of the developed ANN models with a sequential modelling approach were demonstrated with a practical application using a data set collected from a full-scale WWTP during 2~years. The results show that the ANN with the sequential modelling approach successfully developed multivariate dynamic models of BOD, COD, SS, and TN removal with satisfactory estimation and prediction capability. Thus, the proposed method could be used as a powerful tool for the prediction of complex and nonlinear WWTP performance.},

  abstract = {This work aims to correlate signals of LED UV/fluorescence sensor with the degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trace-level organic contaminants (TOrCs) during ozonation process. Six sets of bench-scale ozonation kinetic experiments incorporated with three different water matrices and 14 TOrCs of different reactivity (group I~{$\sim{}~$}V) were conducted. Calibrated by tryptophan and humic substances standards and verified by the lab benchtop spectroscopy, the newly developed portable/online LED sensor, which measures the UV280 absorbance, protein-like and humic-like fluorescence simultaneously, was feasible to monitor chromophores and fluorophores with good sensitivity and accuracy. The liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector combined with 2D synchronous correlation analysis further demonstrated how the DOM components of large molecular weight were transformed into small moieties as a function of the decrease of humic-like fluorescence. For TOrCs, their removal rates were well correlated with the decrease of the LED UV/fluorescence signals, and their elimination patterns were mainly determined by their reactivity with O3 and hydroxyl radicals. At approximately 50\% reduction of humic-like fluorescence almost complete oxidation of TOrCs of group I and II was reached, a similar removal percentage (25\textendash{}75\%) of TOrCs of group III and IV, and a poor removal percentage ({$<$}25\%) of group V. This study might contribute to the smart control of advanced oxidation processes for the water and wastewater treatment in the future.},

  abstract = {Today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are large, complex, and affixed with networked sensors and actuators that are targets for cyber-attacks. Conventional detection techniques are unable to deal with the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of the CPSs. On the other hand, the networked sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be continuously monitored for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental results showed that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by various attacks with high detection rate and low false positive rate as compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {The use of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation as a physical wastewater disinfection has increased in recent years, especially for wastewater reuse. The UV-TiO2 can generate OH radicals, which is highly effective to inactivate microorganisms in wastewater disinfection. However, both UV and UV-TiO2 disinfections create multiple physical, chemical, and bio-chemical phenomena that affect their germicidal efficiency. It is difficult to build a precise control model using existing mathematic models. This study applies artificial neural network (ANN) models to control UV and UV-TiO2 disinfections. Experimental results indicate that the ANN models, which precisely generate relationships among multiple monitored parameters, total coliform counts in influent and effluent, and UV doses, can be used as control models for UV and UV-TiO2 disinfections. A novel ANN control strategy is applied to control UV and UV-TiO2 disinfection processes to meet three total coliform count limits for three wastewater reuse purposes. The proposed controlled strategy effectively controls UV and UV-TiO2 disinfection, resulting in acceptable total coliform counts in effluent for the three wastewater reuse purposes. The required UV doses for UV-TiO2 disinfection were lower than those for UV disinfection, resulting in energy saving and capacity reduction of 13.2\textendash{}15.7\%.},

  abstract = {A cascade control strategy is proposed to the benchmark simulation model 1 (BSM1) to enhance the treatment performance of nitrogen removal in a biological wastewater treatment plant. The proposed control approach consists of two control loops, a primary outer loop and a secondary inner loop. The method has two controllers of which the primary loop has a model predictive control (MPC) controller and the secondary loop has a proportional-integralderivative (PID) controller, which is a cascade MPC-PID controller. The primary MPC controller is to control the nitrate concentration in the effluent, and the secondary PID controller is to control the nitrate concentration in the final anoxic compartment. The proposed method controls the nitrate concentrations in the effluent as well as in the final anoxic reactor simultaneously to strictly satisfy the quality of the effluent as well as to remove the effects of disturbances more quickly by manipulating the external carbon dosage rate. Because the control performance assessment (CPA) technique has the features of determining the capability of the current controller and locating the best achievable performance, the other novelty of this paper is to suggest a relative closed-loop potential index (RCPI) which updates the CPA technology into a closed-loop cascade controller. The proposed method is compared with a cascade PID-PID control strategy and the original PID controller in BSM1 and an improved performance of the suggested cascade MPC-PID controller is obtained by using the CPA approach.},

However, the presence of unreliable data, coupled with increasing demands for measurement quality assurance, has rendered inadequate such a simplistic view. In this paper, a probabilistic self-validating soft-sensor is proposed with the capability of performing self-diagnostics, self-reconstruction and online uncertainty measurement. In this framework, data collecting for softsensor modeling (easy-to-measure data) is validated by a Variational Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (VBPCA) model before performing a soft-sensor model construction. By integrating Relevant Vector Machine (RVM) as a predictive model, not only prediction values are obtained, but also the credibility of information for easy-to-measure and hard-to-measure quantities can be generated. The performance of the proposed soft-sensor is validated through two simulation studies of WWTPs with different process characteristics. The results suggest that the proposed strategy significantly improves the prediction performance.},

As with the Hotelling's {$\chi$}2 and multivariate CUSUM charts, the ARL performance of the multivariate EWMA chart depends on the underlying mean vector and covariance matrix only through the value of the noncentrality parameter. Worst-case scenarios show that Hotelling's {$\chi$}2 charts should always be used in conjunction with multivariate CUSUM and EWMA charts to avoid potential inertia problems.

Multivariate latent variable monitoring and fault diagnosis methods are reviewed and contrasted with classical fault detection and diagnosis approaches. The integration of monitoring and diagnosis techniques by using an adaptive agent-based framework is outlined and its use for fault-tolerant control is compared with alternative fault-tolerant control frameworks.

A data-driven approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy clustering extracting the necessary monitoring information solely out of transmembrane pressure data was investigated for this purpose. Out of three tested PCA techniques the two functional methods proved useful to cope with noise and outliers as opposed to the common standard PCA, while all of them presented similar capabilities for revealing data trends and patterns. The expert functional PCA approach enabled linking the two major trends in the data to reversible fouling and irreversible fouling. The B-splines approach provided a more objective way for functional representation of the data set but its complexity did not appear justified by better results. The fuzzy clustering algorithm, applied after PCA, was successful in recognizing the data trends and placing the cluster centres in meaningful positions, as such supporting data analysis. However, the algorithm did not allow a correct classification of all data. Factor analysis was used instead, exploiting the linearity of the observed two dimensional trends, to completely split the reversible and irreversible fouling effects and classify the data in a more pragmatic approach. Overall, the tested techniques appeared useful and can serve as the basis for automatic membrane fouling monitoring and control.},

  abstract = {Advanced control of chemical disinfection processes is becoming increasingly important in view of balancing under-treatment (low pathogen inactivation) and over-treatment (excessive consumption of disinfectant and disinfection byproducts formation) thereby providing considerable environmental and economic benefits. Conventional control strategies such as flow pacing or residual trim ignore chemical demand/decay, inactivation kinetics, and other factors governing disinfection performance in continuous-flow reactors such as reactor hydraulics and process variability. This study presents the development, verification, and pilot-scale validation of a novel CT-based real-time disinfection control strategy, derived from first principles, and applied to peracetic acid disinfection of municipal secondary effluent wastewater. Validation experiments were carried out using a 3-m3 pilot contact basin of which the hydraulic performance was first characterized by means of tracer tests and then mathematically modeled using the well-established theoretical framework of continuous stirred-tank reactors in series. The analytical model describing hydraulic performance was subsequently extended to take into account disinfectant demand/decay and microbial inactivation kinetics. The integrated model was successfully used to predict, and control, residual peracetic acid as well as microbial concentration in the pilot effluent. Validation studies conclusively supported that the novel CT-based control strategy was superior in maintaining constant disinfection performance, desired microbial counts, and low residual disinfectant under variable flow and wastewater quality. When compared with flow pacing, the CT-based control required two times less the amount of chemical for the same treatment objective ({$<$}100 cfu/100 mL). Remarkably, the CT-based control strategy could be extended to other chemical disinfection processes such as chlorination and ozonation, alone or in combination with physical treatment technologies such as membranes and ultraviolet irradiation.},

The model took into consideration the aeration required for biological oxidation in aerobic MBRs (AeMBRs), the energy recovery from methane production in anaerobic MBRs (AnMBRs) and the energy demands of operating submerged and sidestream membrane configurations. Aeration and membrane energy demands were estimated based on previously developed modelling studies populated with operational data from the literature. Given the difference in sludge production between aerobic and anaerobic systems, the model was benchmarked by assuming high sludge retention times or complete retention of solids in both AeMBRs and AnMBRs. Analysis of biogas production in AnMBRs revealed that the heat required to achieve mesophilic temperatures (35\textdegree{}C) in the reactor was only possible with influent wastewater strengths above 4\textendash{}5 g COD L-1. The general trend of the submerged configuration, which is less energy intensive than the sidestream configuration in aerobic systems, was not observed in AnMBRs, mainly due to the wide variation in gas demand utilized in anaerobic systems. Compared to AeMBRs, for which the energy requirements were estimated to approach 2 kWh m-3 (influent up to 1 g COD L-1), the energy demands associated with fouling control in AnMBRs were lower (0.80 kWh m-3 for influent of 1.14 g COD L-1), although due to the low fluxes reported in the literature capital costs associated with membrane material would be three times higher than this.},

At similar doses, NaOCl was more effective than PAA, and its action was less affected by contact time. The results obtained by ozonation were comparable for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and E. coli. On the contrary, some differences among the three indicators were observed for NaOCl, PAA, and UV. Differences increased with increasing values of the disinfectant concentration times contact time (C x t) and were probably the result of different initial counts, as total coliforms include fecal coliforms, which include E. coli. The UV irradiation lead to complete E. coli removals, even at low doses (10 to 20 mJ/cm2). Total heterotrophic bacteria appeared to be too wide a group to be a good disinfection indicator; no correlation was found among THB inactivation, dose, and contact time.},

It has also been well received by industrial practitioners; however, industrial applications have had mixed results. In this paper, we focus on our experiences in developing multivariate statistical systems for industrial use. From these experiences, we identify a methodology for developing useful, long-standing industrial applications. We highlight features we feel are important in the successful development of on-line MVS applications, both technical and non-technical. Specifically, we focus on on-line systems for manufacturing environments. Many of the applications discussed grew out of industry-university collaborations. To end the paper, we recommend topics open for further academic research with an industrial focus.},

Emphasis is given to the selection of a control configuration that contributes to minimising the economic costs while improving the removal efficiency of the nitrogen compounds. For this task, a simple dynamic matrix control algorithm is favoured for controlling the nitrogen concentrations at the end of the biological process. The behaviour of the activated sludge process is reproduced in a commercial simulator that acts as a real-time testing platform and that is also used for identifying the multivariable input\textendash{}output models for the predictive controller. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, different control configurations are considered and compared against the aeration control strategies currently used at the plant. Based on the simulation results, this work shows the potentiality of the dynamic matrix control which is able to decrease the energy consumption costs and, at the same time, reduce the ammonia peaks and nitrate concentration in the effluent.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to find the optimum solid retention time (SRT) of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which minimizes operating costs, using a modeling approach with WEST software by MIKE DHI\textregistered. For the determination of the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters (used for the correct calibration of the model implemented), respirometric and kinetic batch tests were carried out. Each Oxidation ditch was modeled by a sequence of four aerated activated sludge units (ASUs) and four anoxic ASUs with recirculation. The model is able to simulate the separation efficiency of the secondary settler, which is generally quite low: in fact, the industrial origin of the wastewater induces the formation of small flocs, the dimensions of which can be further reduced by the presence of surface aerators. The nitrification/denitrification process is also accurately predicted. Using data obtained from the model, mass balances at the steady state for COD and N were made and compared to the ones obtained using measured data. After calibration and validation of the model, steady-state simulations were carried out by increasing and decreasing the SRT of the system under two different operational conditions used by the managing company and by evaluating the costs related to the water treatment line and the sludge treatment line for each scenario. It is interesting to note how the total costs are lower in summer than in winter (7.2 \texteuro{}cent/m3 in summer and 8.7 \texteuro{}cent/m3 in winter, in scenario 0). In general, the increase in the SRT led to a decrease in the total management costs. In fact, differences between scenario 0 and the scenario with the lowest total treatment costs (corresponding to an SRT of 11.4 d in winter and 10.0 d in summer) could give rise to total savings of about 44{$\cdot$}000\texteuro/year in summer and 93{$\cdot$}000\texteuro/year in winter.},

  abstract = {Producing reclaimed water meeting water quality standards for agricultural and industrial demands is a viable option to the Tabriz area, East Azerbaijan, Iran, due to water scarcity. This study focuses on the Tabriz wastewater treatment plant (TWWTP) and investigates its treatability. This research proposes an ensemble of fuzzy logic (FL) models as surrogates for the TWWTP to avoid simulating complex physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes. Each FL model predicts water quality parameters of TWWTP using measured influent water quality data, such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, temperature, and total suspended solids. Instead of looking for the best FL forecasting model, this study introduces a supervised committee FL (SCFL) model as a predictive ensemble model for effluent water quality. The SCFL model uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to combine forecasted water quality results from individual FL models. Three FL models of Takagi-Sugeno, Mamdani, and Larsen are the surrogates for TWWTP. Compared to the historical data on effluent water quality, the individual FL models have a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for BOD, COD and TSS in the testing step ranging between 10\% and 13\%. Using the CFL model, the MAPE in the testing step reduces to 5\%\textendash{}7\%. The SCFL model further reduces MAPE to 4\% in the testing step. The SCFL model is an alternative to predict the quality of effluent water parameters by performing better than the individual FL and CFL models for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.},

In this research, a simple feed-forward artificial neural network, trained by error backpropagation algorithm, was used as a tool to relate peak Cryptosporidium and Giardia concentrations with other biological, chemical and physical parameters in surface water. Multiple water quality parameters at a water treatment plant intake on the Delaware River, New Jersey, USA, collected in 1996, were provided to the authors for recognition analysis. Water samples were classified as ``background'' and ``above background'' based on the concentrations of full and empty oocysts and cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The results of this preliminary effort were encouraging. Parameters significant to the identification of each protozoa were identified, eight for Cryptosporidium and seven for Giardia by a stepwise elimination technique. Data withheld from the model training was used to validate the trained models and evaluate the most effective internal architecture. In both cases, the best prediction performance was found when the number of internal nodes was twice that of the input parameters in single hidden-layer architecture. Predictions for the classification of the verification data set resulted in no false-negatives (mis-prediction of above background protozoa concentrations) when the models were optimally trained.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in data-driven process control and performance analysis could provide the wastewater treatment industry with an opportunity to reduce costs and improve operations. However, big data in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is widely underutilized, due in part to a workforce that lacks background knowledge of data science required to fully analyze the unique characteristics of WWTP. Wastewater treatment processes exhibit nonlinear, nonstationary, autocorrelated, and co-correlated behavior that (i) is very difficult to model using first principals and (ii) must be considered when implementing data-driven methods. This review provides an overview of data-driven methods of achieving fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced control of WWTP. We present how big data has been used in the context of WWTP, and much of the discussion can also be applied to water treatment. Due to the assumptions inherent in different data-driven modeling approaches (e.g., control charts, statistical process control, model predictive control, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy logic), not all methods are appropriate for every goal or every dataset. Practical guidance is given for matching a desired goal with a particular methodology along with considerations regarding the assumed data structure.

In some engineered systems, designed features can create a known multistate scheme among multiple autocorrelated, nonlinear, and nonstationary processes, and incorporating this additional known information into AD-PCA can further improve it. In simulations with one of three types of faults introduced, we compare accounting for the states versus ignoring them. We find that multistate AD-PCA reduces the proportion of false alarms and reduces the average time to fault detection. Conversely, we also investigate the impact of assuming multiple states when only one exists, and find that as long as the number of observations is sufficient, this misspecification is not detrimental. We then apply multistate AD-PCA to real-world data collected from a decentralized wastewater treatment system during in control and out of control conditions. Multistate AD-PCA flags a strong system fault earlier and more consistently than its single-state competitor. Furthermore, accounting for the physical switching system does not increase the number of false alarms when the process is in control and may ultimately assist with fault attribution.},

  abstract = {With the growth of statistical modeling in the ecological sciences, researchers are using more complex methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), to address problems associated with pattern recognition and prediction. Although in many studies ANNs have been shown to exhibit superior predictive power compared to traditional approaches, they have also been labeled a ``black box'' because they provide little explanatory insight into the relative influence of the independent variables in the prediction process. This lack of explanatory power is a major concern to ecologists since the interpretation of statistical models is desirable for gaining knowledge of the causal relationships driving ecological phenomena. In this study, we describe a number of methods for understanding the mechanics of ANNs (e.g. Neural Interpretation Diagram, Garson's algorithm, sensitivity analysis). Next, we propose and demonstrate a randomization approach for statistically assessing the importance of axon connection weights and the contribution of input variables in the neural network. This approach provides researchers with the ability to eliminate null-connections between neurons whose weights do not significantly influence the network output (i.e. predicted response variable), thus facilitating the interpretation of individual and interacting contributions of the input variables in the network. Furthermore, the randomization approach can identify variables that significantly contribute to network predictions, thereby providing a variable selection method for ANNs. We show that by extending randomization approaches to ANNs, the ``black box'' mechanics of ANNs can be greatly illuminated. Thus, by coupling this new explanatory power of neural networks with its strong predictive abilities, ANNs promise to be a valuable quantitative tool to evaluate, understand, and predict ecological phenomena. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {ICA \textendash{} instrumentation, control and automation \textendash{} is a hidden technology. It is ubiquitous in all industrial processes, including water and wastewater treatment systems. Still, as long as everything works fine, it is not noted but when things go wrong it will be observed. ICA has now about forty years of history in water and wastewater systems and is well recognized. One early attitude was that ICA will be a necessary burden to be added to a plant in order to correct for a poor design. However, the key reason for ICA is the fact that all processes are subject to disturbances, externally via the wastewater influent, from the customers in a water supply system, or from operations in one unit process that will propagate as a disturbance to another unit within a plant. This paper is an attempt to describe the development of ICA in water and wastewater systems. Most of it is based on personal experiences with all their limitations. No single paper can fairly describe the development that is documented in thousands of research papers, practiced by so many operators and process engineers and implemented in so many treatment systems. Still, the hope is that the paper can give a flavour of the most important ingredients of this fascinating development.},

Now that use of selectors has become more common for achieving low SVI values, the assessment of the full-scale performance characteristics of activated sludge plants incorporating selectors has high value for the design and operation of future plants. Treatment plant effluent quality is seldom analyzed solely on an average basis and the impact peak events have on effluent quality must be considered in design and operation. Descriptive statistics should also be used to assess selector performance, so that the influence of infrequently occurring values on plant design and operation can be assessed. The performance of 21 activated sludge plants incorporating selectors was evaluated. All the selector plants for which post installation data were available showed that the operating SVI values were significantly improved. One plant studied in detail showed that final effluent quality was significantly better after the selector installation. As a group, activated sludge plants with anaerobic selectors outperform those with anoxic selectors. Dissolved oxygen control is just as important in activated sludge plants with selectors as in conventional activated sludge plants.},

The applied traditional model performances are found insufficient, since the characteristic behaviors of the time series of direct runoff coefficients are very complicated. Therefore, a new Hybrid approach is adopted by using time series decomposition procedure and ANN. ARIMA, ARIMAX, ANN, and Hybrid models are compared with each other. The results indicate that the new generated Hybrid approach can be generalized to boost the prediction capability of ANNs in complicated time series data. It is seen that the new model captures the physical behavior of the direct runoff coefficient time series. The semi-random spikes of the direct runoff coefficient series are approximated sufficiently.},

The training, validating and testing procedures for the effluent COD, total organic carbon (TOC) and oil and grease (O\&G) concentrations were successful and a good correlation was observed between the measured and predicted values. The results showed that at OLR of 2.44kgCOD/(m3day), TDS of 78,000mg/L and reaction time (RT) of 40h, the average removal rate of COD was 98\%.

Performance data from a pilot-scale, multiple-compartment anaerobic reactor taken over 786 days were subjected to comprehensive statistical analyses. Results suggest that chemical oxygen demand (COD) was a poor proxy for organics in anaerobic systems as oxygen demand from dissolved inorganic material, dissolved methane, and colloidal material influence dissolved and particulate COD measurements. Additionally, univariate and functional boxplots were useful in visualizing variability in contaminant concentrations and identifying statistical outliers. Further, significantly different dissolved organic removal and methane production was observed between operational years, suggesting that anaerobic reactor systems may not achieve steady-state performance within one year. Last, modeling multiple-compartment reactor systems will require data collected over at least two years to capture seasonal variations of the major anaerobic microbial functions occurring within each reactor compartment.

In this paper data driven methods are performed to monitor the WWTP behaviour. The aim is to predict its effluent concentrations in order to reduce possible violations and their derived costs. To do so, an alarm generation system based on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is proposed. The proposed system shows a good prediction accuracy (errors around 5\%) and a reduced miss-detection probability (30\%).},

But for many processes, the observations are correlated, and when this correlation build-up automatically in the entire process, it is known as autocorrelation. Autocorrelation among the observations can have significant effect on the performance of a control chart. The detection of special cause/s in the process may become very difficult in such situations. Several types of control charts and their combinations are evaluated for their ability to detect changes in the process mean and variance, since two decades. To counter the effect of autocorrelation, various new methodologies and approaches such as double sampling, variable sample sizes and sampling intervals, etc. are suggested by various researchers. Researchers also used Markov chain, timeseries approach, MATLAB and artificial neural networks for the simulation of the data. This paper provides a survey and brief summary of the work on the development of the control charts for variables to monitor the mean and dispersion for autocorrelated data.},

  abstract = {A reverse osmosis (RO) process is often included in the treatment train to produce high quality reuse water from treated effluent for potable purposes because of its high removal efficiency for salinity and many inorganic and organic contaminants, and importantly, it also provides an excellent barrier for pathogens. In order to ensure the continued protection of public health from pathogen contamination, monitoring RO process integrity is necessary. Due to their small sizes, viruses are the most difficult class of pathogens to be removed in physical separation processes and therefore often considered the most challenging pathogen to monitor. To-date, there is a gap between the current log credit assigned to this process (determined by integrity testing approved by regulators) and its actual log removal capability as proven in a variety of laboratory and pilot studies. Hence, there is a challenge to establish a methodology that more closely links to the theoretical performance. In this review, after introducing the notion of risk management in water reuse, we provide an overview of existing and potentially new RO integrity monitoring techniques, highlight their strengths and drawbacks, and debate their applicability to fullscale treatment plants, which open to future research opportunities.},

The Boosting-IPW-PLS method incorporates IPW into boosting scheme to suppress the quality-irrelevant variables by assigning small weights, and builds up the models for the wastewater quality predictions based on the weighted variables. The monitoring system was tested in the field with satisfactory results, underlying the potential of this technique for the online monitoring of water quality.},

  abstract = {This article considers statistical process control (SPC) of univariate processes when the parametric form of the process distribution is unavailable. Most existing SPC procedures are based on the assumption that a parametric form (e.g., normal) of the process distribution can be specified beforehand. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that their performance is unreliable in cases when the prespecified process distribution is invalid. To overcome this limitation, some nonparametric (or distribution-free) SPC charts have been proposed, most of which are based on the ordering information of the observed data. This article tries to make two contributions to the nonparametric SPC literature. First, we propose an alternative framework for constructing nonparametric control charts, by first categorizing observed data and then applying categorical data analysis methods to SPC. Under this framework, some new nonparametric control charts are proposed. Second, we compare our proposed control charts with several representative existing control charts in various cases. Some empirical guidelines are provided for users to choose a proper nonparametric control chart for a specific application. This article has supplementary materials online.},

  abstract = {Reliable performance evaluation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be done by simulating the plant behavior over a wide range of influent disturbances, including series of rain events with different intensity and duration, seasonal temperature variations, holiday effects, etc. Such simulation-based WWTP performance evaluations are in practice limited by the long simulation time of the mechanistic WWTP models. By moderate simplification (avoiding big losses in prediction accuracy) of the mechanistic WWTP model only a limited reduction of the simulation time can be achieved. The approach proposed in this paper combines an influent disturbance generator with a mechanistic WWTP model for generating a limited sequence of training data (4months of dynamic data). An artificial neural network (ANN) is then trained on the available WWTP input-output data, and is subsequently used to simulate the remainder of the influent time series (20years of dynamic data) generated with the influent disturbance generator. It is demonstrated that the ANN reduces simulation time by a factor of 36, even when including the time needed for the generation of training data and for ANN training. For repeated integrated urban wastewater system simulations that do not require repeated training of the ANN, the ANN reduces simulation time by a factor of 1300 compared to the mechanistic model. ANN prediction of effluent ammonium, BOD5 and total suspended solids was good when compared to mechanistic WWTP model predictions, whereas prediction of effluent COD and total nitrogen concentrations was a bit less satisfactory. With correlation coefficients R2{$>$}0.95 and prediction errors lower than 10\%, the accuracy of the ANN is sufficient for applications in simulation-based WWTP design and simulation of integrated urban wastewater systems, especially when taking into account the uncertainties related to mechanistic WWTP modeling.},

Data reconciliation for wastewater treatment modeling is a demanding task, and standardized approaches are lacking. This paper suggests a procedure to obtain high-quality data sets for model-based studies. The proposed approach starts with the collection of existing historical data, followed by the planning of additional measurements for reliability checks, a data reconciliation step, and it ends with an intensive measuring campaign. With the suggested method, it should be possible to detect, isolate, and finally identify systematic measurement errors leading to verified and qualitative data sets. To allow mass balances to be calculated or other reliability checks to be applied, few additional measurements must be introduced in addition to routine measurements. The intensive measurement campaign should be started only after all mass balances applied to the historical data are closed or the faults have been detected, isolated, and identified. In addition to the procedure itself, an overview of typical sources of errors is given. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The objective of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is to prevent pollution. However, it is necessary to assess their sustainability in order to ensure that pollution is being removed, not displaced. In this research, the performance of 24 WWTPs has been evaluated using a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Eutrophication Potential (EP) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) as environmental indicators, and operational costs as economic indicators. WWTPs were further classified in six typologies by their quality requirements according to their final discharge point or water reuse. Moreover, two different functional units (FU), one based on volume (m3) and the other on eutrophication reduction (kg PO43- removed) were used to further determine sustainability. A correlation between legal requirements and technologies used to achieve them was found: Organic matter removal plants were found to be less costly both in environmental and economic terms if volume was used as the functional unit, while more demanding typologies such as reuse plants showed a trade-off between lower EP and higher cost and GWP; however, this is overcome if the second FU is used instead, proving the sustainability of these options and that this FU better reflects the objectives of a WWTP.},

  abstract = {In this work extensions to principal component analysis (PCA) for wastewater treatment (WWT) process monitoring are discussed. Conventional PCA has some limitations when used for WWT monitoring. Firstly, PCA assumes that data are stationary, which is normally not the case in WWT monitoring. Secondly, PCA is most suitable for monitoring data that display events in one time-scale. However, in WWT operation, disturbances and events occur in different time-scales. These two limitations make conventional PCA unsuitable for WWT monitoring. The first limitation can be overcome by use of adaptive PCA. In adaptive PCA, the PCA model is continuously updated using an exponential memory function. Variable mean, variance and co-variance are thus adapted to the changing conditions. The second problem can be solved by time-scale decomposition of data prior to analysis. The time-scale decomposition methodology involves wavelets and multiresolution analysis (MRA) in combination with PCA. MRA provides a tool for investigation and monitoring of process measurement at different time-scales by decomposing measurement data into separate frequency bands. Time-scale decomposition increases the sensitivity of the monitoring, which makes it possible to detect small but significant events in data displaying large variations. Moreover, time-scale information is sometimes important in the interpretation of a disturbance to determine its physical cause. Also, by decomposing data, the problem of changing process conditions is partly solved. All the presented methods are illustrated with examples using real WWT process data.},

Apart from sampling, sludge was retained completely by a submerged hollow fibre membrane with a pore-size of 0.2{$\mu$}m. The pilot plant comprised an anoxic zone to enable denitrification. The maximum liquid hold-up of the plant was 3.9m3. In this study the reactor performance and the stability of the process and the membrane capacity were investigated. A stable flux of 18lm-2h-1 could be realised with a mean transmembrane pressure difference of 0.3bar with air-bubbling and backflushing the membrane and cleaning it in place every two months for one or two hours. For about 140d, a flux of 27lm-2h-1 was achieved, but cleaning became necessary more often. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) varied between 10.4 and 15.6h. Accordingly the volumetric loading rate was between 1.1 and 1.7kg CODm-3d-1. No inoculum was used. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration gradually increased to 18\textendash{}20g MLSSl-1. The feed to microorganism (F/M) ratio varied according to the operation conditions but decreased against a value of 0.07kg CODkg-1 MLSSd-1. Treatment performance was very stable and on a high level. The COD was reduced by 95\%. Nitrification was complete and up to 82\% of the total nitrogen could be denitrified.},

Trials were carried out with increasing doses (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 mg/L) and contact times (6, 12, 18, 36, 42, and 54 minutes) to study disinfectant decay and bacterial removal and regrowth, using fecal coliform and Escherichia coli (E. coli) as process efficiency indicators. Peracetic acid decay kinetics was evaluated in tap water and wastewater; in both cases, PAA decays according to first-order kinetics with respect to time, and a correlation was found between PAA oxidative initial consumption and wastewater characteristics. The PAA disinfection efficiency was correlated with operating parameters (active concentration and contact time), testing different kinetic models. Two data groups displaying a different behavior on the basis of initial active concentration ranges (1 to 2 mg/L and 5 to 15 mg/L, respectively) can be outlined. Both groups had a "tailing-off" inactivation curve with respect to time, but the second one showed a greater inactivation rate. Moreover, the effect of contact time was greater at the lower doses. Hom's model, used separately for the two data groups, was found to best fit experimental data, and the disinfectant active concentration appears to be the main factor affecting log-survival ratios. Moreover, the S-model better explains the initial resistance of E. coli, especially at low active concentrations ({$<$} 2 mg/L) and short contact times ({$<$} 12 minutes). Microbial counts, performed by both traditional methods and flow cytometry, immediately and 5 hours after sample collection (both with or without residual PAA inactivation), showed that no appreciable regrowth took place after 5 hours, neither for coliform group bacteria, nor for total heterotrophic bacteria.},

Early detection of abnormal events allows actions to prevent more serious consequences, improve the system's performance and reduce manufacturing costs. In this work, a new methodology for fault detection is introduced, based on time series models and statistical process control (MSPC). The proposal explicitly accounts for both dynamic and non-linearity properties of the system. A dynamic feature selection is carried out to interpret the dynamic relations by characterizing the auto- and cross-correlations for every variable. After that, a time-series based model framework is used to obtain and validate the best descriptive model of the plant (either linear o non-linear). Fault detection is based on finding anomalies in the temporal residual signals obtained from the models by univariate and multivariate statistical process control charts. Finally, the performance of the method is validated on two benchmarks, a wastewater treatment plant and the Tennessee Eastman Plant. A comparison with other classical methods clearly demonstrates the over performance and feasibility of the proposed monitoring scheme.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of O3/granular activated carbon (GAC) to enhance ozone transformation into {$\cdot$}OH radicals, with the common advanced oxidation processes (O3/OH-, O3/H2O2). The results obtained with model systems under the given experimental conditions showed that the system O3/OH- (pH 9) and O3/H2O2 (pH 7, [H2O2] = 1{$\cdot$}10-5 M) are more efficient than O3/GAC (pH 7, [GAC] = 0.5 g/L) to enhance ozone transformation into {$\cdot$}OH radicals. However, in Lake Zurich water the O3/GAC process has a similar efficiency as O3/H2O2 for ozone transformation into {$\cdot$}OH radicals. The results also show that the presence of GAC during Lake Zurich water ozonation leads to (i) removal of hydrophilic and hydrophobic micropollutants, (ii) reduction of the concentration of CO3 2-/HCO3 -, and (iii) decrease of the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present in the system.},

The Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 is used as working scenario. The hierarchical structure allows to adjust the dissolved oxygen in the fifth tank (SO,5) according with the working conditions, instead of keeping it in a fixed value. Model Predictive Control (MPC) with inlet flow rate feedforward control (MPC+FF) is proposed for the lower level to control nitrate nitrogen concentration of the second tank and SO,5. MPC, Affine Function and fuzzy controller are tested for the higher level to adjust the SO,5 set point of the lower level based on the ammonium and ammonia nitrogen concentration in the fifth tank. Modifying the tuning parameters of the higher level, a tuning region is determined, in which the effluent quality and operational costs are simultaneously improved.},

  abstract = {Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use of the more relevant inputs. However, this will lead to an intractable number of hyperparameters. Here, we introduce Regularization Learning Networks (RLNs), which overcome this challenge by introducing an efficient hyperparameter tuning scheme which minimizes a new Counterfactual Loss. Our results show that RLNs significantly improve DNNs on tabular datasets, and achieve comparable results to GBTs, with the best performance achieved with an ensemble that combines GBTs and RLNs. RLNs produce extremely sparse networks, eliminating up to 99.8\% of the network edges and 82\% of the input features, thus providing more interpretable models and reveal the importance that the network assigns to different inputs. RLNs could efficiently learn a single network in datasets that comprise both tabular and unstructured data, such as in the setting of medical imaging accompanied by electronic health records. An open source implementation of RLN can be found at https://github.com/irashavitt/regularization\_ learning\_networks.},

A key theme throughout the book is that it makes sense to base inferences or conclusions only on valid models. Plots are shown to be an important tool for both building regression models and assessing their validity. We shall see that deciding what to plot and how each plot should be interpreted will be a major challenge. In order to overcome this challenge we shall need to understand the mathematical properties of the fitted regression models and associated diagnostic procedures. As such this will be an area of focus throughout the book. In particular, we shall carefully study the properties of resi- als in order to understand when patterns in residual plots provide direct information about model misspecification and when they do not. The regression output and plots that appear throughout the book have been gen- ated using R. The output from R that appears in this book has been edited in minor ways.

  abstract = {Modelling activated sludge systems has gained an increasing momentum after the introduction of activated sludge models (ASMs) in 1987. Application of dynamic models for full-scale systems requires essentially a calibration of the chosen ASM to the case under study. Numerous full-scale model applications have been performed so far which were mostly based on ad hoc approaches and expert knowledge. Further, each modelling study has followed a different calibration approach: e.g. different influent wastewater characterization methods, different kinetic parameter estimation methods, different selection of parameters to be calibrated, different priorities within the calibration steps, etc. In short, there was no standard approach in performing the calibration study, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to (1) compare different calibrations of ASMs with each other and (2) perform internal quality checks for each calibration study. To address these concerns, systematic calibration protocols have recently been proposed to bring guidance to the modeling of activated sludge systems and in particular to the calibration of full-scale models. In this contribution four existing calibration approaches (BIOMATH, HSG, STOWA and WERF) will be critically discussed using a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. It will also be assessed in what way these approaches can be further developed in view of further improving the quality of ASM calibration. In this respect, the potential of automating some steps of the calibration procedure by use of mathematical algorithms is highlighted.},

Samples collected from 24 wastewater drains in Lucknow city and from three sites on Gomti river in the month of January/February, May, August and November during the period of 5 years (1994\textendash{}1999) were characterized for 32 parameters. The multivariate techniques successfully described the similarities/dissimilarities among the sewage drains on the basis of their wastewater characteristics and sources signifying the effect of routine domestic/commercial activities in respective drainage areas. Spatial and seasonal variations in wastewater composition were also determined successfully. CA generated six groups of drains on the basis of similar wastewater characteristic. PCA provided information on seasonal influence and compositional differences in sewage generated by domestic and industrial waste dominated drains and showed that drains influenced by mixed industrial effluents have high organic pollution load. DA rendered six variables (TDS, alkalinity, F, TKN, Cd and Cr) discriminating between cis- and trans-drains. PLS\textendash{}DA showed dominance of Cd, Cr, NO3, PO4 and F in cis-drains wastewater. The results suggest that biological-process based STPs could treat wastewater both from the cis- as well as trans-drains, however, prior removal of toxic metals will be required from the cis-drains sewage. Further, seasonal variations in wastewater composition and pollution load could be the guiding factor for determining the STPs design parameters. The information generated would be useful in selection of process type and in designing of the proposed sewage treatment plants (STPs) for safe disposal of wastewater.},

Due to cyclical weather cycles, drought, and climate change, water stress has increased worldwide including in Southern California, which serves as a model for regions that integrate reuse of wastewater for both potable and non-potable use. The Orange County Water District (OCWD) Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) is a highly engineered system designed to treat and produce up to 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of purified water from a municipal wastewater source for potable reuse. Routine facility microbial water quality analysis is limited to standard indicators at this and similar facilities. Given recent advances in high throughput DNA sequencing techniques, complete microbial profiling of communities in water samples is now possible. By using 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing coupled to a highly accurate identification method along with 16S rRNA gene qPCR, we describe a detailed view of the total microbial community throughout the facility. The total bacterial load of the water at stages of the treatment train ranged from 3.02 \texttimes{} 106 copies in source, unchlorinated wastewater feed to 5.49 \texttimes{} 101 copies of 16S rRNA gene/mL after treatment (consisting of microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet/advanced oxidation). Microbial diversity and load decreased by several orders of magnitude after microfiltration and reverse osmosis treatment, falling to almost non-detectable levels that more closely resembled controls of molecular grade laboratory water than the biomass detected in the source water. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes and viruses was also greatly reduced. Overall, system design performance was achieved, and comprehensive microbial community analysis was found to enable a more complete characterization of the water/wastewater microbial signature.},

First, a reduced nonlinear model is presented, which is based on expression for nitrification reaction rate in activated sludge model No. 1 and modified for attached biomass processes, while second, a linear black-box model is shown. The data used for model identification were collected during several weeks of experiments on a real plant so that good identification data were obtained. The designed models were validated based on open loop simulations and predictions. Validation results show that the reduced nonlinear model performs better compared to the linear model, however, both models show relatively large errors compared to the real plant data. Hence, a closed loop simulation study was performed to see the differences between the performance of model predictive controller using previously estimated linear and nonlinear models and a standard proportional integral (PI) controller. From the simulation study results it was seen that in spite of relatively large model errors the MPC algorithms give better results in terms of ammonia removal compared to the PI controller, while MPC with the nonlinear model shows additional improvements over the MPC with the linear model.},

  abstract = {ﾑPublic acceptanceﾒ is often seen as a key reason why water recycling technology is (accepted or) rejected. This paper examines the ways problems of water sustainability are defined by revisiting the notion of ﾑpublic acceptanceﾒ of water recycling. A common assumption is that projects fail because the general public is unable to comprehend specialist information about risk and the belief therefore, that if the public were better informed, they would accept change more readily. This is often assumed to be the reason for the failure of water recycling schemes, particularly those involving domestic and/or personal uses of the product water. This paper, in contrast, suggests that rhetoric about ﾑacceptanceﾒ is counterproductive in progressing sustainability as it does not address underlying issues relating to institutional arrangements and reinforces a dichotomy between expert and ﾑlayﾒ groups. Instead, institutional change is needed to build opportunities for constructive public engagement about deeply held values. The failure to implement sustainable water use through recycling can be understood as the result of several factors, including the present cost structures for water, institutional conservatism, administrative fragmentation and inadequate involvement of communities in planning. These factors constrain the definition of the problems and scope of acceptable solutions, resulting in the potential loss of economic and environmental opportunities to the community. Achieving sustainable water use through recycling may require better co-ordination between agencies and integrated government policies to overcome this complex and fragmented institutional framework.},

  abstract = {Two common causes of filamentous bulking of activated sludge are low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and low food to microorganism (F/M) ratio in the activated sludge system. A dynamic mathematical model was developed to simulate the population dynamics of two groups of bacteria, floc-formers and filaments within the microenvironment of the activated sludge floc. An arbitrary grid of 50 by 50 elements was applied to a hypothetical floc of maximum 100 {$\mu$}m in diameter. The concentration of DO and soluble substrate was calculated inside the floc core under different bulk concentration conditions in order to simulate the effect of heterogeneous, gradient-governed microenvironments on dual species composition. Dynamic simulation runs were performed to calculate the growth of the two morphological types of microorganisms inside the floc under diffusion governed conditions. The results indicate that the method accurately predicts the onset of excessive filamentous growth (directly linked to bulking) even when traditional models neglecting diffusion limitation fail to do so. The positive feedback effect of the non-random (unidirectional) growth on the selective enrichment of filamentous organisms under electron acceptor (DO) or soluble substrate (F/M) limited conditions is demonstrated.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

In this domain, efficient pump energy management can generate economic and environmental benefits. Although the availability of on-line sensors can provide high-frequency information about pump systems, at best, energy assessment is carried out a few times a year using aggregated data. Consequently, pump inefficiencies are normally detected late and the comprehension of pump system dynamics is often not satisfactory. In this paper, a data-driven methodology to support the daily energy decision-making is presented. This innovative approach, based on fuzzy logic, supports plant managers with detailed information about pump performance, and provides case-based suggestions to reduce the pump system energy consumption and extend pump life spans. A case study, performed on a WWTP in Germany, shows that it is possible to identify energy inefficiencies and case-based solutions to reduce the pump energy consumption by 18.5\%.},

In these processes, oxygen is a key substrate in animal cell metabolism and its consumption is thus a parameter of great interest for the monitoring. In this paper, are presented and discussed the results of the dissolved oxygen (DO) control in a SBR pilot plant based on a predefined 8h step-feed cycle. As first approach, the application of classical methods (on/off and PID) was considered. Due to the non-linear character of the process, the PID parameter adjusting was very difficult and the obtained results showed a beating phenomenon around the setpoint. This phenomenon was more and less amplified according to the step of the cycle and the water pollution level. The second approach to achieve more stable DO control was based on a fuzzy logic strategy, taking into account the step and the difference between the measured DO and the setpoint. In this case, control action performances were highly improved. It is also shown that, using the fuzzy controller, the pH profile made it possible to clearly detect the ammonia valley during the aerobic phases. Thus, fuzzy logic proved to be a robust and effective DO control tool, easy to integrate in a global monitoring system for cost managing.},

We investigated different scenarios of daily average influent CBOD and influent flow rate measured at 15min intervals.

  abstract = {A simple model for evaluating energy demand arising from aeration of an MBR is presented based on a combination of empirical data for the membrane aeration and biokinetic modelling for the biological aeration. The model assumes that aeration of the membrane provides a proportion of the dissolved oxygen demanded for the biotreatment. The model also assumes, based on literature information sources, a linear relationship between membrane permeability and membrane aeration up to a threshold value, beyond which permeability is unchanged with membrane aeration. The model was benchmarked against two full-scale plant to obtain the most appropriate and conservative value of the slope of the flux:aeration curve and the blower efficiency. Benchmarking in this way produced a match to within 20\% of all key process plant operational parameters. The model demonstrated that significant reductions in aeration energy could be obtained through operation at lower flux and reducing the membrane aeration requirement accordingly, so-called ``proportional aeration'' at lower flows. Similarly, increasing oxygen transfer from membrane aeration would also be expected to decrease energy demand. A sensitivity analysis of some of the key parameters revealed that, of the key operating parameters, loading, SOTE and MLSS concentration remain the most critical in determining energy demand. It is suggested that a key parameter representing membrane aeration in MBRs is the mean in-module air upflow velocity U, since this gives a reasonable representation of the shear applied through membrane aeration. U was found to vary between 0.04 and 0.1m/s across a number of modern large pilot and full-scale plant. An analysis reveals that significant reductions in energy demand are attained through operating at lower MLSS levels and membrane fluxes. Evidence provided from recent controlled pilot trials implies that halving the flux can reduce the aeration is suggested whereby the number of membrane tanks on line and/or the membrane aeration intensity is adjusted according to the flow, and thus flux, so as to reduce the overall aeration energy demand.},

The forecast model utilizes a simple representation of daily NH4+ profiles and the dilution approach combined with information from online NH4+ and flow sensors. The method utilizes an ensemble approach based on past observations to create model prediction bounds. The forecast model was tested against observations collected at the inlet of two WWTPs over an 11-month period. NH4+ data were collected with ion-selective sensors. The model performance evaluation focused on applications in relation to online control strategies. The results of the monitoring campaigns highlighted a high variability in daily NH4+ profiles, stressing the importance of an uncertainty-based modelling approach. The maintenance of the NH4+ sensors resulted in important variations of the sensor signal, affecting the evaluation of model structure and its performance. The forecast model succeeded in providing outputs that potentially can be used for integrated control of wastewater systems. This study provides insights on full scale application of online water quality forecasting models in sewer systems. It also highlights several research gaps which \textendash{} if further investigated \textendash{} can lead to better forecasts and more effective real-time operations of sewer and WWTP systems.},

Starting with the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) control loop in the last aerated tank, the control of the recirculation sludge is added next. Once the limitations of this two-loop control strategy are highlighted, a cascade control loop is proposed. This cascade control is further enhanced by a feed-forward control action that makes use of influent ammonia concentration. The resulting cascade+feedforward control configuration achieves satisfactory nitrogen removal for the three influent operating conditions (dry, rain and storm).},

  abstract = {Proportional\textendash{}integral\textendash{}derivative (PID) controllers are the most adopted controllers in industrial settings because of the advantageous cost/benefit ratio they are able to provide. Despite their long history and the know-how gained from years of experience, the availability of microprocessors and software tools and the increasing demand for higher product quality at reduced cost have stimulated researchers to devise new methodologies to improve their performance and make them easier to use. Practical PID Control covers important issues that arise when a PID controller is to be applied in practical cases. Its focus is on those functionalities that can provide significant improvements in performance in combination with a sound tuning of parameters. In particular, the choice of filter to make the controller proper, the use of a feedforward action and the selection of an anti-windup strategy are addressed. Further, the choice of the identification algorithm and of the model reduction technique are analysed in the context of model-based PID control. Widely adopted PID-based control architectures (ratio and cascade control) and performance assessment are also covered. For these topics, recent contributions are explained and compared with more standard approaches. A large number of simulation and experimental results are provided in order better to illustrate the different methodologies and to discuss their pros and cons. Practical PID Control is a helpful and instructive reference for researchers, graduate students and practitioners in process control.},

To facilitate wastewater treatment and reuse, tailored to local needs, a hybrid membrane treatment process is proposed that couples sequencing batch reactors with a membrane bioreactor (SBR-MBR). In this study, we explored the flexibility and robustness of this hybrid membrane system at a demonstration-scale under real-world conditions by tightly managing and controlling operation conditions to produce effluent of different qualities for multipurpose reuse. Results suggest that an SBR-MBR treatment configuration is flexible, robust and resilient to changing operating conditions. The hybrid system was capable of producing different effluent qualities within 1 week of changing operating condition with no adverse effects on membrane performance. This work reinforces the need for a new paradigm of water reclamation and reuse and introduces a new treatment concept facilitating tailored nutrient management for a sustainable urban water infrastructure.},

  abstract = {The resilience of microbial communities to press disturbances and whether ecosystem function is governed by microbial composition or by the environment have not been empirically tested. To address these issues, a whole-ecosystem manipulation was performed in a full-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. The parameter solids retention time (SRT) was used to manipulate microbial composition, which started at 30 days, then decreased to 12 and 3 days, before operation was restored to starting conditions (30-day SRT). Activated sludge samples were collected throughout the 313-day time series in parallel with bioreactor performance (`ecosystem function'). Bacterial small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes were surveyed from sludge samples resulting in a sequence library of {$>$}417 000 SSU rRNA genes. A shift in community composition was observed for 12- and 3-day SRTs. The composition was altered such that r-strategists were enriched in the system during the 3-day SRT, whereas K-strategists were only present at SRTs12 days. This shift corresponded to loss of ecosystem functions (nitrification, denitrification and biological phosphorus removal) for SRTs12 days. Upon return to a 30-day SRT, complete recovery of the bioreactor performance was observed after 54 days despite an incomplete recovery of bacterial diversity. In addition, a different, yet phylogenetically related, community with fewer of its original rare members displaced the pre-disturbance community. Our results support the hypothesis that microbial ecosystems harbor functionally redundant phylotypes with regard to general ecosystem functions (carbon oxidation, nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus accumulation). However, the impacts of decreased rare phylotype membership on ecosystem stability and micropollutant removal remain unknown.},

In order to improve the network performance, fuzzy subtractive clustering was used to identify model's architecture and optimize fuzzy rule, meanwhile principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the input variable dimensionality. Input variables were reduced from six to four for COD and SS models, by considering PCA results and linear correlation matrices among input and output variables. The results indicate that reasonable forecasting and control performances have been achieved through the developed system. The minimum mean absolute percentage errors of 1.003\% and 0.5161\% for CODeff and SSeff could be achieved using ANFIS. The maximum correlation coefficient values for CODeff and SSeff were 0.9912 and 0.9882, respectively.

However, a comprehensive review on membrane cleaning in MBRs is still lacking. This paper attempts to critically review the recent developments of membrane cleaning. Firstly, the fouling and cleaning fundamentals are addressed, and then a comprehensive review on physical, chemical, and biological/biochemical cleaning is presented. The procedures of determining proper cleaning protocols for MBR systems are also proposed. Finally, the existing challenges and future research efforts are discussed in order to ensure the development of membrane cleaning toward a more effective and sustainable way in MBRs.},

Because OPPPs establish and grow as part of the native drinking water microbiota, they do not correspond to fecal indicators, presenting a significant challenge to common and effective monitoring strategies. Further, different OPPPs present distinct requirements for sampling, preservation, and analysis, creating a significant impediment to their parallel detection. The aim of this critical review is to synthesize the state of the science of monitoring OPPPs and to identify a path forward for their simultaneous detection and quantification in a manner commensurate with the need for reliable data to inform risk assessment and mitigation. Water and biofilm sampling procedures, as well as factors influencing sample representativeness and detection sensitivity, are critically evaluated with respect to the five representative bacterial and amoebal OPPPs noted above. Available culturing and molecular approaches are discussed in terms of their advantages, limitations, and applicability. Knowledge gaps and research needs are identified.},

PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure\textendash{}Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure\textendash{}Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

The resulted fault diagnosis statistic, the sum of squared residuals (SPE) can be predicted over a long horizon by performing a multi-step ARMA model (Auto-Regressive and Moving Average Model). The proposed fault diagnosis framework has been validated by process data collected from two WWTPs with different dynamic characteristics. The results showed that the proposed methodology is capable of detecting sensor faults and process faults with good accuracy under different scenarios (highly and lowly instrumented WWTP).},

  abstract = {A literature survey was conducted to appraise the recent applications of artifical intelligence (AI)-based modeling studies in the environmental engineering field. A number of studies on artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems (ANFIS) were reviewed and important aspects of these models were highlighted. The results of the extensive literature survey showed that most AI-based prediction models were implemented for the solution of water/wastewater (55.7\%) and air pollution (30.8\%) related environmental problems compared to solid waste (13.5\%) management studies. The present literature review indicated that among the many types of ANNs, the three-layer feed-forward and back-propagation (FFBP) networks were considered as one of the simplest and the most widely used network type. In general, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) was found as the best-suited training algorithm for several complex and nonlinear real-life problems of environmental engineering. The literature survey showed that for water and wastewater treatment processes, most of AI-based prediction models were introduced to estimate the performance of various biological and chemical treatment processes, and to control effluent pollutant loads and flowrates from a specific system. In air polution related environmental problems, forecasting of ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, daily and/or hourly particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were found to be widely modeled. For solid waste management applications, reseachers conducted studies to model weight of waste generation, solid waste composition, and total rate of waste generation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, six different strategies for integrated control of nitrate recirculation flow rate and external carbon addition in a pre-denitrifying biological wastewater treatment system are proposed and evaluated using the COST simulation benchmark. The proposed control strategies consist of two or three feedback control loops, which manipulate the nitrate recirculation and the carbon dosage flow rates in an integrated manner, such that the consumption of external carbon is minimized while the nitrate discharge limits are met. The control systems require measurements of nitrate concentrations at the end of both the anoxic and the aerobic zones. A number of simulations are performed and the results show that the control strategies can maintain the designated effluent quality in the presence of external disturbances, while obtaining excellent results in terms of consumption of external carbon, as well as meeting the general plant performance and controller criteria as defined by the benchmark group.},

A series of wastewater chlorination and dechlorination experiments were conducted in a continuous laboratory-scale reactor. The ORP and pH variations in raw wastewater, and chlorination and dechlorination reactors were monitored on-line. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to build control models using the monitored ORP and pH data. Another series of continuous experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed control strategy for meeting different requirements for total coliform counts and residual chlorine concentrations for different wastewater reclamation purposes. The dynamical controlled experimental results show that chlorination and dechlorination were effectively controlled, and that appropriate disinfection efficiencies were achieved and remaining chlorine residuals in effluent were controlled simultaneously for different treatment targets. This ANN control method is simple and has potential benefits in reducing chemical costs for wastewater chlorination and dechlorination.},

Thirty-nine TOrCs were evaluated in two distinct secondary wastewater effluents in terms of estimated photochemical reactivity, as a function of the rate constants of UV direct photolysis (kUV) and hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation (kOH). The selected eighteen TOrCs were classified into three groups that served as indicator compounds: Group 1 for photo-susceptible TOrCs but with minor degradation by OH oxidation (diclofenac, fluoxetine, iohexol, iopamidol, iopromide, simazine and sulfamethoxazole); Group 2 for TOrCs susceptible to both direct photolysis and OH oxidation (benzotriazole, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, naproxen and sucralose); and Group 3 for photo-resistant TOrCs showing dominant degradation by OH oxidation (atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, gemfibrozil, primidone and trimethoprim). The results indicate that TOC (optical-based measurement), UVA254 or UVT254 (UV absorbance or transmittance at 254~nm), and total fluorescence can all be used as suitable on-line organic surrogate parameters to predict the attenuation of TOrCs. Furthermore, the automated real-time monitoring via on-line surrogate sensors and equipped with the developed degradation profiles between sensor response and a group of TOrCs removal can provide a diagnostic tool for process control during advanced treatment of reclaimed waters.},

This work presents a static data-driven model to predict the key performance indicators of the aerobic granulation process. The first sub-model receives influent characteristics and granular sludge properties. These predicted parameters then become the input for the second sub-model, predicting the effluent characteristics. The model was developed with a dataset of 2600 observations and evaluated with an unseen dataset of 286 observations. The prediction R2 and RMSE were {$>$}99\% and {$<$}5\% respectively for all predicted parameters. The results of this paper show the effectiveness of data-driven models for simulating the complex aerobic granulation process, providing a great tool to help in predicting the behaviour, and anticipating failures in aerobic granular reactors.},

The model is built by the MLP neural network. The accuracy of the prediction result of MLP neural network is compared with the accuracy of the result of traditional stational autoregressive model(AR). The conclusion is that the percentage error prediction model of the MLP neural network (PE), the fractional deviation (FB), normalized mean square error (NMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) prediction model of evaluation index is better than the AR model. In other words, the prediction model based on MLP neural network provides a reliable basis for reducing the energy consumption in the activated sludge process of industrial waste water treatment and further improving its effect on the treatment of industrial waste water.},

The five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), a critical parameter for WRP process control, is expensive and difficult to measure using hard-sensors. An alternative approach based on a soft-sensor methodology shows promise, but can be problematic when used to predict high BOD5 values. Underestimating high BOD5 concentrations for process control could result in an insufficient amount of aeration, increasing the risk of an effluent violation. To address this issue, we tested a hierarchical hybrid soft-sensor approach involving multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and compromise programming. While this hybrid approach results in a slight decrease in overall prediction accuracy relative to the approach based on ANN only, the underestimation percentage is substantially lower (37\% vs. 61\%) for predictions of carbonaceous BOD5 (CBOD5) concentrations higher than the long-term average value. The hybrid approach is also flexible and can be adjusted depending on the relative importance between energy savings and managing the risk of an effluent violation.},

  abstract = {The lasso is a popular technique for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. Lasso variable selection has been shown to be consistent under certain conditions. In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients in the {$\mathscr{l}$}1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our theory, the nonnegative garotte is shown to be consistent for variable selection.},
